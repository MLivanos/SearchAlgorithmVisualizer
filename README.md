# Search Algorithm Visualizer

Hello Fellow AI Educators and Learners!

The goal of this repo is to provide a visual understanding of different search algorithms using Unity to visualize the process. This project is inspired by [Clement Mihailescu's Similar Algorithm Visualizer](https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/#), but with a few important distinctions. Namely, this is in Unity. This allows you to download the project and modify it however you'd like with your own art assets to draw a narrative, modify the codebase to add new algorithms, and styles of mazes, or extend the project however you'd like. Further, I also add some customizability options that are useful for my purposes and may be useful for yours, such as a float to denote how fast the maze is solved, and descriptive coloring for every cell.
